## Linear Regression

This folder contains implementation for a linear regression model. It includes the following components:

- Single variable linear regression
- Gradient descent
- Closed-form linear regression
- Forward feature selection
- Multivariate linear regression

---

## Decision Trees

This folder contains implementation for a decision tree classifier. It includes the following components:

- Gini impurity measure
- Entropy value measure
- Goodness of split
- Depth pruning
- Chi pruning

---

## MAP Classifier

This folder contains implementation for a MAP (maximum a posteriori) classifier. It includes the following components:

- Maximum likelihood estimation
- Normal naive Bayes classifier
- Full Bayes classifier

---

## Logistic Regression, Bayes, and EM

This folder contains implementation for a logistic regression model, Bayes classifier and EM parameter estimation. It includes the following components:

- Cross-validation
- Normal distribution PDF
- Expectation maximization (EM)
- GMM (Gaussian mixture model)
- Naive Bayes
- Model evaluation

---

## Clustering - k-means

This folder contains implementation for a k-means unsupervised classifier.
